Garments E-Commerce Website
The Garments E-Commerce Website is a fully responsive online store built using Next.js (v14), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This website allows users to browse a range of garments, including T-shirts, jeans, and shorts for men, women, and kids. The platform offers a smooth user experience with a dynamic product listing, a promotional "50% Off" banner on the homepage, product details pages, and a shopping cart feature for easy checkout.

The tech stack includes Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance, TypeScript for type safety, and Tailwind CSS for a highly customizable and responsive design. The website is deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast and scalable hosting. The platform features interactive UI elements such as filtering options for products, displaying product details (including images and sizes), and adding/removing items from the cart with real-time updates. The static pages, such as "Contact Us", "Return Policy", and "About Us", provide additional customer support and company information.

Tech Stack
The website leverages Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to provide a seamless user experience and optimize the development process. The front-end uses React state and local storage to handle cart functionality. The project is hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast loading times and a global content delivery network (CDN).

Project Structure
The projectâ€™s structure is simple and follows best practices for Next.js development. The main components are located within the src/app/components and src/app/pages directories, with images stored in the public/images/products folder. The styling is handled through globals.css and tailwind.css for easy customization and responsiveness.

How to Run the Project
To run the project locally, start by cloning the repository and navigating into the project directory. After that, install all necessary dependencies by running npm install. Finally, run the project with npm run dev, and it will be available at http://localhost:3000 for local development and testing.

Key Workflows
The primary workflows include browsing products, viewing their details, and managing the cart. Products are dynamically fetched and displayed with various filter options such as category, size, and color. Users can view detailed information about each product, including images and price, and easily add products to their cart. The cart page allows users to manage their cart by adding or removing items, with real-time updates on quantity and total cost.

Future Enhancements
There are future plans to integrate a payment gateway for processing transactions and implement a backend system to manage customer orders and user accounts. Additionally, real-time shipment tracking is an intended feature for providing users with updates about their order status.
